Exciting news! ‚ö°‚ö°

This Spring Clara will be participating in the **Behavioral Insights Academy** at the **United Nations Office for Counter-Terrorism**.

As part of the UN International Hub on [**Behavioral Insights to Counter Terrorism**](https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/behavioural-insights), Clara will provide training and mentoring to practitioners, UN program managers, civil society organizations, and member state government officials in charge of Counter Terrorism programs. 

The goal of the BI Academy is to help practitioners apply and evaluate behavioral insights into their programs. A behavioural insights approach enables the identification of risk and resilience factors and the development of empirically validated interventions for policymakers and practitioners to effectively prevent and counter violent extremism.

The Behavioral Insights Hub is a¬†global platform for creating knowledge around behavioural insights to prevent and counter terrorism, disseminating lessons learned and good practices, and creating a professional network of experts, academics, practitioners, and policymakers.

Very excited to take part in this!

Big announcement! üéâüéâ

**We have been awarded the** **internationally competitive [BIAL Foundation grant](https://fundacaobial.com/com/grants/)** to research cognitive flexibility effects on vulnerability to misinformation!

This is a project we conceived together with the [**Center for Brain at Cognition**](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc) at the UPF. The aim is to evaluate whether cognitive flexibility correlates (estimated using EEG) predict vulnerability to partisan misinformation in participants with right-leaning and left-leaning political attitudes.

We are also very interested in distinguishing political orientation from political extremity effects in vulnerability to misinformation. This is because political extremity is usually associated with cognitive rigidity and could be impacting how people respond to misinformation more so than political orientation.

We are excited to start this project and to provide responses to all of these questions!

üëâüèº¬†**We will be announcing a research assistant position** **opening** for this project soon. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClaraPretus) or [Mastodon](https://c.im/@ClaraPretus) if you don‚Äôt want to miss it!

### üìå October, 2022

**We officially started the VALAWAI project!**

It was great to meet our project partners at the Kick-off meeting, which took place in Castelldefels (Barcelona) on October 11th and 12th. 

We are collaborating with an exciting team of computer scientists at the [Artificial Intelligence Research Institute](https://www.iiia.csic.es/en-us/) (Barcelona, Spain), social media researchers at [Sony Computer Science Labs](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/) (Paris, France), roboticists at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) (Ghent, Belgium), and human-robot interaction researchers at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it/) (Genoa, Italy).  

We forgot to take pictures of the event, but here is us having dinner to celebrate.  

Exciting times ahead!
