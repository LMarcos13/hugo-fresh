### ðŸ“Œ October, 2022

**We officially started the VALAWAI project!**

It was great to meet our project partners at the Kick-off meeting, which took place in Castelldefels (Barcelona) on October 11th and 12th. 

We are collaborating with an exciting team of computer scientists at the [Artificial Intelligence Research Institute](https://www.iiia.csic.es/en-us/) (Barcelona, Spain), social media researchers at [Sony Computer Science Labs](https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/) (Paris, France), roboticists at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) (Ghent, Belgium), and human-robot interaction researchers at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it/) (Genoa, Italy).  

We forgot to take pictures of the event, but here is us having dinner to celebrate.  

Exciting times ahead!
