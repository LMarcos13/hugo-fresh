## BIAL: Neurocognitive correlates of vulnerability to misinformation (2023-2027)

In our most recent project, we will be researching whether cognitive flexibility correlates (estimated using EEG) predict vulnerability to partisan misinformation ****in participants with right-leaning and left-leaning political attitudes. 

This is a project we conceived together with the [Center for Brain at Cognition](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc) at the UPF and has been funded by the [BIAL Foundation](https://fundacaobial.com/com/grants/).
